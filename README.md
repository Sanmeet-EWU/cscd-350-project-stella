# TakeThat!
A brief description of our project
 
TakeThat! is a social media application that sends users a daily notification 
to take a photo of something around them with a specific criteria. Users have
five minutes to take a photo.

With the age of social media, people often find themselves trying to be
picture perfect. We want you to live in the moment. A place where you and 
I can communicate without the additional worries social media entails. 

We envision a social networking app that encompasses close friends, creating a fun and lively
enviroment for people to socialize through photos online without worries or a second thought
about how they look. We want real interaction.
