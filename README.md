### Project Description

TakeThat! Is a fun and modern take of social media. We envision an mobile application where users can get notified to take a daily photo with a certain prompt. You can interact with friends and have your own social group. Social media today creates pressure to be perfect, causing stress and inauthentic interactions.

### Intended User

Teens and young adults looking for a more genuine way to connect with friends online.

### Why This Problem Exists

With the age of social media, people often find themselves trying to be picture perfect. We want you to live in the moment. A place where you and I can communicate without the additional worries social media entails.

### How Our Solution Helps

TakeThat! encourages real moments with limited-time promptsâ€”making sharing fun, fast, and worry-free.
