## Developer Guidelines

## The layout of directory structure.
Directory consists of 3 folders (diagrams, takethat_project, .idea)
  
Here is a high-level view of the folder structure for your reference.
  
diagrams
  ->images
take_thatproject
  ->project contents
.idea

## Folder contents
Diagrams and images contains nessecary diagrams
takethat_project contains all nessecary contents to run the software
  
## How to build the software.
In order to build the software you must download Android Studio and Flutter SDK. We did this in VSCode where you can install the flutter and dart extensions.

• How to test the software.

• How to add new tests.

• How to build a release of the software. Describe any tasks
that are not automated. For example, should a developer
update a version number (in code and documentation) prior
to invoking the build system? Are there any sanity checks a
developer should perform after building a release?
