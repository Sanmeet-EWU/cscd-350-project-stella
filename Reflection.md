# Reflection

Working on this project was a great learning experience for our team. After designing UI pages and connecting them to the backend over the past few weeks, we moved on to testing. Testing was one of the challenging but important parts. At first, we thought it would be hard to test our app because most of it was UI-based. However, we learned that even UI apps can be tested, especially input validation, navigation, and interaction with Firebase.  We also learned how to use the flutter_test package, mocks, and coverage tools to support our testing goals. It took a while and errors, but we were able to write tests that helped improve our app.
Team Contributions:

- Ashley: wrote UI tests for the login, sign-up, and setting pages. Verified that input fields and buttons were working. Made sure widgets showed correctly and tested that navigation between pages was accurate.

- Zach:

- Brayden: Wrote tests for the UI elements of core pages such as story page, user home page and user posts. Learned along the way how to generate the coverage file and examine what pages still had very few tests which helped me pick which classes to write tests for. 

This was our first time writing tests in Flutter, and it felt very different from what weâ€™ve done before, so it taught us how to test both the frontend and backend. Writing tests made us think about how users interact with our app and helped catch small bugs that we never thought of.
